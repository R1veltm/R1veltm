👋 Hi, I’m @TomGirshovski

👀 I’m interested in web development, app development, and open-source projects.

🔭 I’m currently working on a few apps that will make your life as a developer or just a normal PC user easier.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on begginer - intermidiate apps and projects.

⚡ Fun fact about me: I'm always learning on the way.
