ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TomGirshovski

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development, app development, and open-source projects.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few apps that will make your life as a developer or just a normal PC user easier.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning algorithms and improving my front-end development skills.

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on begginer - intermidiate apps and projects.

âš¡ Fun fact about me: I'm learning always on the way.
